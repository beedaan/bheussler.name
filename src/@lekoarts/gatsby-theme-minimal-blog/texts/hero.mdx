  Hi.
</Text>

I'm Brendan - currently living and breathing in San Diego, California.  I'm a software engineer at [Swing AI](https://swingai.golf/).
We built a [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swing-index/id1364108595) that helps you get better at golf.
Currently, I'm working on a [side project](./my-new-side-project) and writing about it.
