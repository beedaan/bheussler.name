## In Defense of Java

* Java is great because of the JVM
* Java is not a new language and there are tons of developers.  Minimum training time
* Java is Free

## Small size projects

* Java seems to be ubiquitous with the enterprise
* I haven't used Java on side projects because of development overhead, managing servlet container.
* Node.js and Express fit the need of a quick and dirty backend.

## Spring Boot

* Quick to start up
* Dependency Management
    * Versions are managed by The Spring Team.  You don't have to worry about compatibility
    * Dependencies are mature
* Focus on Business Logic
