You know how when you go to the movies with your friends and while you're watching the previews, there's movie trivia that comes up?  What if you could actually submit your answers and compete with the rest of the audience.  You wouldn't have to download an app or even login, you would just have to enter a special URL and you would be in.  That's the elevator pitch of my new side project and since naming things is the hardest part about programming, it's going to be called MovieQuiz.

The cool part about the experience is that you don't *need* your phone.  You could play along like you always would and just keep score in your head.  I believe that smartphones are amazing in so many ways, but they often get in the way of interacting with the world around us.  Instead, I'd like to create technology that enhances an experience that already exists.

I like this project because the idea is concise.  It's easy to describe it and people can immediately see it's value.  There's also a lot of different applications that could come out of the same project.  It could be used in a bar for trivia or it could be played at a house party on a Chromecast, just to name a few.

## Motivation

I'm going to use this idea to learn some new technologies that I wouldn't normally use in my day job.  SwingAI has a pretty robust stack with some of the latest frameworks, but I want an excuse to play around with some other frameworks I keep hearing about.

I also want to build a web application from the ground up.  Every side project I've done so far has just been a static website.  I want to go through the process of deciding what database I'm going to use, how my deployment will run, the whole nine yards.  My focus is going to be on simplicity.  I'm just a one man team.  I don't want a complicated infrastructure.  I want the ability to focus on just the business logic as much as possible.

There are two frameworks that look particularly interesting: React Native and NativeScript.  Apparently these frameworks let you write an app in Javascript, and then compile it to iOS and Android.  If that's true and if it's actually viable, that means I would be able to build a mobile app without knowing Swift or the Android SDK.  This would be an incredibly powerful skill to know.

I'm going to write about my decisions as I go through them.  This industry leans heavily on blog article and online documentation.  My stock as a software developer goes up if I could get a blog post that becomes the go-to resource for something like selecting a database. I wrote an article on Medium awhile back that described [Partial Collapses in Bootstrap 3](https://medium.com/@beedaan/partial-collapse-with-bootstrap-3-ef4e6bf85537).  The article got some good traction, but today I think Medium is a terrible platform to publish to and I'd rather own my own content.

## MVP

Version 1 of the app is going to be a web application.  I don't want users to have to download anything.  There's also not going to be a main display screen.  Integrating with a movie theater is going to be complicated.  I'm not sure if the preview reel is a roll of film, or if it's a digital display.  If it is a digital display, can we dynamically change what is projected?  These are problems I don't want to worry about right now.

The quiz will be controlled from a mobile phone.  There will be a QuizMaster who sets up the quiz.  He'll share the quiz URL with the participants.  Once the participants are in the lobby, the QuizMaster will start the quiz.  The application will take care of the rest of the experience from there.

There will be no user accounts.  I don't want there to be any roadblocks between the players and the quiz.  The names will initialize as `Anonymous01` and so on.  The players will have the ability to change their display name, but that feature will be totally optional.  I want the players to feel like their identity is protected, but I also want to give them the option to put their name in if they feel comfortable.  I'll have to implement an input black list to prevent players from entering profanity.

Each quiz will have a theme.  The QuizMaster will select the theme when he's setting up the quiz.  The themes will be along the lines of `Action`, `Horror`, and other movie genres. The quiz will have a series of multiple choice questions.  The players will have a short amount of time to enter each question so they can't look up the answers online.

After each question, the app will display the current leaderboard with all of the participants.  The quiz URL will also be displayed so that new players can join in the middle.  Players that join in the middle will be taken to the current question in the quiz.  The'll start with 0 correct answers and be at a disadvantage, but they will be in the quiz.

At the end of the quiz, the application will display the final leaderboard and congratulate the winner.  That will conclude the MovieQuiz experience.

## Potential Problems

If you've read this much, then you've probably noticed the elephant in the room.

> If you think this is a good idea, why are you sharing it with everyone?

First of all, it's not an original idea.  I think Nintendo already has something like it called Jambox.  More importantly though, ideas are cheap, execution is golden.  Instagram proves this point to the moon and back.

I want to build the app and blog about my experience simultaneously.  This could potentially be too ambitious.  I might stop working on the app if I feel like I can't keep up with the blog posts.  This is all a side project so if I feel like I can't make enough progress, I might just drop everything.

I want to share my experience with you because I want to learn myself.  By explaining the process in a blog, it will help understand what I am building.  It also opens up the potential for two way collaboration.  Remember, I'm just working on this by myself for now.  I don't want to be alone with my thoughts!
