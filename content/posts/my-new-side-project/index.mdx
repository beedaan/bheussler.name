You know how when you go to the movies with your friends and while you're watching the previews, there's movie trivia that comes up?  It's a fun little game to pass the time before the movie starts and casual impromptu competition between you and your friends.  You didn't decide, "Hey, I'm going to play this trivia game", it just sort of happened.

I really enjoy small moments like those.  You sort of forget whatever is going on and you are immediately engaged in that moment.  Christopher Nolan, one of my favorite directors, has a production company called Syncopy.  The word itself is a medical term for fainting or loss of consciousness.  His movies draw you in, in such a way that you as the viewer have a syncopic experience.  That is, completely forgetting about you and your own thoughts for a brief moment.

Now, that's a pretty lofty goal to accomplish, but it's something to aspire to do.  If Christopher Nolan were to create a piece of technology, I'd imagine it being like Uber or Tinder.  You as the user don't think about "How do I do this thing?".  Immediately you look at it and it makes sense.  Not only does it make sense, you start using it and you forget that you're using an app on your phone.  You're now getting a ride somewhere or your looking for that next match.

So, sticking with the idea of an interface that just disappears to the background, I want to combine that philosophy with the fun that happens when you compete with your friends.  The idea that comes to my mind immediately is the movie quiz that happens in theaters.  What if you could use your phone to submit your answers and keep track of the score?  But now your not just competing with your friends, your competing with all of the strangers in the audience.  Let's say you're late to the party and you've not been paying attention, or maybe you just decided you'll watch along but not submit your own answers.  That's totally fine, you can just play along in your head without using your phone at all.  This technology should not replace what we have already, it should only improve upon it.  You'll just gave to be comfortable with seeing some guy named Bruce on top of the leaderboard instead of you ;-)

No logins, no downloading, names are even optional.  Streamlining the user experience is going to be a pillar of the app.  The rest of the pillars, well, I'm still figuring that out.  My goal is to write about my decisions as I go through them.  I can already tell you that it's not going to be a linear journey.  I actually started working on this project last December.  I've already done a complete 360 on some of my decisions.  For the sake of transparency, I'm going to go back and write about those as if they were happening in real time.  Why?  Because I actually learned from it.  I've been able to take what I've learned on this side project and apply it to my day job.

My project has the working name of MovieQuiz.  Naming things is the hardest part of programming.  *If* I get far enough along that I need to seriously start marketing this bad boy, I'll probably change the name.  Something that ends in a 'fy'.  For version 1, I'm going to build a mobile webapp that can be used on any phone.  For the sake of simplicity and just getting an MVP together, I'm going to skip the integration with a main viewing screen.  The entire experience will be controlled from phones.  There will be a QuizMaster that will configure the quiz.  He'll choose a quiz topic, get a short link URL and distribute it to his friends.  Finally, he'll start the quiz.  His job is done and the quiz runs.

If you've read this much, then you've probably noticed the elephant in the room.

> If you think this is a good idea, why are you sharing it with everyone?

First of all, it's not an original idea.  I think Nintendo already has something like it called Jambox.  More importantly though, ideas are cheap, execution is golden.  If you really have *such* a good idea that you're not going to tell people about it.  Then it's never going to get off the ground because you're too nervous to execute.  Or you're nervous that your execution will be total shit.  Instagram proves this point to the moon and back.

I want to share my experience with you because I want to learn myself.  By explaining the process in a blog, it will help me learn and become a better enigneer.  It also opens up the potential for two way collaboration.  Remember, I'm just working on this by myself for now.  I don't want to be alone with my thoughts!
