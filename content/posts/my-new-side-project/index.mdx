# Work in Progress

You know how when you go to the movies with your friends and while you're watching the previews, there's movie trivia that comes up?  What if you could actually submit your answers and compete with the rest of the audience.  You wouldn't have to download an app or even login, you would just have to enter a special URL and you would be in.  That's the elevator pitch of my new side project and since naming things is the hardest part about programming, it's going to be called MovieQuiz.

The cool part about the experience is that you don't *need* your phone.  You could play along like you always would and just keep score in your head.  I believe that smartphones are amazing in so many ways, but they often get in the way of interacting with the world around us.  Instead, I'd like to create technology that enhances an experience that already exists.

I like this project because the idea is concise.  It's easy to describe it and people can immediately see it's value.  There's also a lot of different applications that could come out of the same project.  It could be used in a bar for trivia or it could be played at a house party on a Chromecast, just to name a few.

## Motivation

I'm going to use this idea to learn some new technologies that I wouldn't normally use in my day job.  SwingAI has a pretty robust stack with some of the latest frameworks, but I want an excuse to play around with some other frameworks I keep hearing about.

I also want to build a web application from the ground up.  Every side project I've done so far has just been a static website.  I want to go through the process of deciding what database I'm going to use, how my deployment will run, the whole nine yards.  My focus is going to be on simplicity.  I'm just a one man team.  I don't want a complicated infrastructure.  I want the ability to focus on just the business logic as much as possible.

I'm going to write about my decisions as I go through them.  This industry leans heavily on blog article and online documentation.  My stock as a software developer goes up if I could get a blog post that becomes the go-to resource for something like selecting a database. I wrote an article on Medium awhile back that described [Partial Collapses in Bootstrap 3](https://medium.com/@beedaan/partial-collapse-with-bootstrap-3-ef4e6bf85537).  The article got some good traction, but today I think Medium is a terrible platform to publish to and I'd rather own my own content

## Potential Problems


I can already tell you that it's not going to be a linear journey.  I actually started working on this project last December.  I've already done a complete 360 on some of my decisions.  For the sake of transparency, I'm going to go back and write about those as if they were happening in real time.  Why?  Because I actually learned from it.  I've been able to take what I've learned on this side project and apply it to my day job.

No logins, no downloading, names are even optional.  Streamlining the user experience is going to be a pillar of the app.  The rest of the pillars, well, I'm still figuring that out.  My goal is to write about my decisions as I go through them.  I can already tell you that it's not going to be a linear journey.  I actually started working on this project last December.

My project has the working name of MovieQuiz.  Naming things is the hardest part of programming.  *If* I get far enough along that I need to seriously start marketing this bad boy, I'll probably change the name.  Something that ends in a 'fy'.  For version 1, I'm going to build a mobile webapp that can be used on any phone.  For the sake of simplicity and just getting an MVP together, I'm going to skip the integration with a main viewing screen.  The entire experience will be controlled from phones.  There will be a QuizMaster that will configure the quiz.  He'll choose a quiz topic, get a short link URL and distribute it to his friends.  Finally, he'll start the quiz.  His job is done and the quiz runs.

If you've read this much, then you've probably noticed the elephant in the room.

> If you think this is a good idea, why are you sharing it with everyone?

First of all, it's not an original idea.  I think Nintendo already has something like it called Jambox.  More importantly though, ideas are cheap, execution is golden.  If you really have *such* a good idea that you're not going to tell people about it.  Then it's never going to get off the ground because you're too nervous to execute.  Or you're nervous that your execution will be total shit.  Instagram proves this point to the moon and back.

I want to share my experience with you because I want to learn myself.  By explaining the process in a blog, it will help me learn and become a better enigneer.  It also opens up the potential for two way collaboration.  Remember, I'm just working on this by myself for now.  I don't want to be alone with my thoughts!
