I've used Java for as long as I've been a coder.
My first computer science class in high school was Java, I used it all throughout college, I got my first internship in Java, which turned into my first job.  I got my Oracle Associate Certificate for Java 7, and I still use Java pretty much on a daily basis.  Even though I've picked up a lot of other languages and specialties like front end web development, I always consider myself a Java developer.  Java has been around for awhile now and that says a lot in the technology world where everything moves at the speed of light.

It's ubiquitous, and sometimes for the wrong reasons.  The Java semicolon is arguably just a popular as the oxford command, but much less forgiving.  There's a certain *stink* of the language due to its verbosity that modern day code hipsters can't stand (unless you're a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/)). Does the language still have any business being used in 2020?  Why did it get so popular in the first place?  For a language that's been so important to my own personal career, I wanted to spend some time to find the answers to these questions.

## Brief History

* Java became popular for the JVM.  Write once, run anywhere
* Any computer, mainframe, or microwave running a JRE could run a Java program
* From a developer's perspective, it was also easier to write because of Garbage Collection, which alleviated the stress of manual memory management.
* Sun Microsystems marketing the hell out of it and it quickly became the defacto language for enterprise applications
* Java is [the most popular language on the TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
    * also https://stackify.com/popular-programming-languages-2018/
* Java has a large community of developers.
    * If you are starting a company or if you are looking for a job, Java is an excellent choice.


## Today

* Compile once, run anywhere is not important anywhere because of virtualization
*

## Strengths

* The strength of Java is the JVM
* The libraries that are available
    * Personal opinion mixed with data.  The java libraries have had years of development and money invested into them
        by enterprise organizations.  They feel mature and production ready, sometimes more useful than Java itself, in the
        case of Google Guava.  In comparison, Node libraries feel like an open beta.
    * JUnit and Mockito
    * Jackson
    * Hibernate
    * Spring
    * A large part of the Java ecosystem is Spring.  I'll write another post on that shortly
* The tooling built around Java
* Performance
    * The JVM fast.  Benchmarking is a dangerous thing to do and I'm not going to tell you it's faster than Javascript (V8)

    * Amazon Story

## Kotlin

* Google announced that [Kotlin will become a first class language on Android](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/)
* Kotlin compiles to Java byte code, which means it runs on the JVM
* It is 100% Interoperable with Java
* It's concise
* It has learned from a lot of the pain points of Java
* It's different than Scala, Groovy, and other JVM languages.  It's more general purpose

## Other JVM languages

* Groovy
    * Dynamically Typed Java.
    * Working with [collections](https://docs.groovy-lang.org/next/html/documentation/working-with-collections.html) is pretty great
    * https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/6wuj1i/what_does_rjava_think_of_groovy/
* Scala
    * Good for big data processing
    * https://www.codementor.io/@jessicathornsby/kotlin-vs-scala-what-should-i-choose-instead-of-java-bwn9axvr8
    * Kotlin has [overtaken Scala](https://snyk.io/blog/kotlin-overtakes-scala-and-clojure-to-become-the-2nd-most-popular-language-on-the-jvm/)

## Conclusion

* Employability is always important to me
* I don't see Java (JVM) going anywhere
* Kotlin could be the next step for the language.  It's officially supported for Android development
* It's built by one of my favorite companies, Jetbrains.  Who make *the best* IDE in the world
