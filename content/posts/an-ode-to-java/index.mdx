* I've used Java my entire career
* When I was in college, I used Scheme, but when it came down to actually implementing something, I used Java

## *Very* Brief History

* Java became popular for the JVM.  Compile once, run anywhere
* Any computer, mainframe, or microwave running a JRE could run a Java program
* Sun Microsystems marketing the hell out of it and it quickly became the darling of enterprise
* The result of this today is that java opens doors

## Java Today

* Compile once, run anywhere is not important anywhere because of virtualization
* The strength of Java is the JVM
* The libraries that are available
    * Hibernate Validation
    * Spring Data
    * Spring Webflux (Non blocking IO)
    * A large part of the Java ecosystem is Spring.  I'll write another post on that shortly
* The tooling built around Java

* Performance - Amazon Story

## Kotlin

* Kotlin compiles to Java byte code, which means it runs on the JVM
* It is 100% Interoperable with Java
* It's concise
* It has learned from a lot of the pain points of Java
* It's different than Scala, Groovy, and other JVM languages.  It's more general purpose

## Conclusion

* Employability is always important to me
* I don't see Java (JRE) going anywhere
* Kotlin could be the next step for the language.  It's officially supported for Android development
* It's built by one of my favorite companies, Jetbrains.  Who make *the best* IDE in the world
