Hi!

I'm Brendan - currently living in San Diego, California.  I'm a software engineer at [Swing AI](https://swingai.golf/).
We have a mobile app that helps golfers get better. I work from home full time, working on the backend services for the app,
as well as the web based dashboards that the instructors use to teach players.

Java is the language that I've been using my entire career.  I've taken an interest in front end development.
I think it's really rewarding to build something and have real users use my website or app.
