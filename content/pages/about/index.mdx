Hi!

I'm Brendan - currently living in San Diego, California.  I'm a Full Stack Software Developer at Intuit.
I'm working on the chat platform used in TurboTax and Quickbooks.
I also worked on the rollout of TurboTax Full Service.

I would describe myself as a well-rounded developer with a strong Java background, that is perpetually interested in best practices.
I look at code as a liability and try to solve problems with the smallest amount of code possible.
I don't try to reinvent the wheel every time because I understand that most problems we face have already been solved by someone else.

I believe the key to success is operational excellence.
I'm always thinking about ways to improve my workflow.
I'm a huge fan of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and tools that can save me a few seconds here and there.
Software is more akin to a living being than a product, and to that end, development is about the journey, not the destination.
