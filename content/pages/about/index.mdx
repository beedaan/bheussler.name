Hi!

I'm Brendan - currently living in San Diego, California.  I'm a software engineer at [Swing AI](https://swingai.golf/).
We built a [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swing-index/id1364108595) that helps you get better at golf.
I work on the backend services for the app.
I also work on the web-based dashboards that the instructors use to interact with players.

I have an affinity for minimalist design.  I also believe in clean code and even cleaner user interfaces.
I enjoy building apps and websites because I like knowing that real users get to see my work.
I don't take myself to seriously because, at the end of the day, I just build websites.
